# Tutorial: Construction of refugee simulation

## Quick examples

### Test example
To run the test example, please run:
```
python3 test_csv.py
```

### CSV-based simulation kernel, with test data
To run the CSV-based simulation kernel, using the test data, please use:
```
python3 run_csv_vanilla.py test_data/test_input_csv test_data/test_input_csv/refugee_data 5 2>/dev/null
```
Here the "2>/dev/null" ensures that any diagnostics are not displayed on the screen. Instead, pure CSV output for the toy model should appear on the screen if this works correctly.

### Simplified simulation of CAR situation, using CSV-based kernel
To run the (simplified) CAR simulation, please use:
```
mkdir outcar
python3 run_csv_vanilla.py examples/car_input_csv source_data/car2014 820 > outcar/out.csv
```
The output will be written to outcar/out.csv. You can visualize the output data using:

```python3 plot-flee-output.py outcar outcar/out```

The output .png files will then appear in the outcar directory.

## Detailed description of steps we have taken

### 1. Select a conflict scenario (country) and simulation (conflict) period

### 2. Download conflict data

* We download conflict data from https://www.acleddata.com/data/acled-version-7-1997-2016/ (providing conflict data for countries in .xlsx format) for chosen country. The .xlsx file with conflict data will have various attributes illustrated in Table 1 below.

* Remove unrequired columns

* Revise **YEAR** column and target chosen simulation period of conflict scenario 

* **EVENT_TYPE** column has 8 different variations: 

    - **Battle**
    
         **Battle-No change of territory**,
         **Battle-Government regains territory**,
         **Battle-Non-state actor overtakes territory**
   - Violence against Civilians
   - Remote Violence
   - Riots and Protests
   - State and Intergovernmental Forces
   - Rebel Forces
   - Political Militias
   Here, we focus on three types of **Battles** of conflict situation and remove other **EVENT_TYPE**.

* After clearing some parts of conflict data file, target the **FATALITIES** column and remove fatalities that are equal to 0 (zero). 

* To identify conflict locations for simulation, choose the first occurrence of each location but exclude syndicated (repeated) locations. 

Example: 

**Table 2. Conflict locations for simulation**
<table>
  <tr>
    <td> …</td>
    <td>LOCATION</td>
    <td>FATALITIES</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> …</td>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> …</td>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>23</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> …</td>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>38</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> …</td>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>7</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> …</td>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>38</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> …</td>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>14</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> …</td>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
  </tr>
</table>


In this example, conflict zone A is repeated with fatalities of 3 and 38 as indicated in Table 2. Choose initial essence of locations (one of each location) as illustrated below: 
* A = 3
* B = 23
* C = 7

### 3. Constructing the CSV files
These filtering of conflict data from ACLED provides conflict location to use in simulation. Use these data construct first **locations.csv** file that has format demonstrated below. 

**locations.csv**
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>name</td>
    <td>region</td>
    <td>country</td>
    <td>lat</td>
    <td>long</td>
    <td>location_type</td>
    <td>conflict_date</td>
    <td>population/capacity</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>AA</td>
    <td>ABC</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
    <td>conflict_zone</td>
    <td>yyyy/mm/dd</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>BB</td>
    <td>ABC</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
    <td>conflict_zone</td>
    <td>yyyy/mm/dd</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>CC</td>
    <td>ABC</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
    <td>conflict_zone</td>
    <td>yyyy/mm/dd</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
  </tr>
</table>


* After identifying conflict location and producing **locations.csv** fill the last column of population for conflict locations. Population distributions can be obtained from https://www.citypopulation.de or other sources.

* Identify destination locations i.e. camps from [UNHCR database](http://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations) and add the information to **locations.csv**

**locations.csv**
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>name</td>
    <td>region</td>
    <td>country</td>
    <td>lat</td>
    <td>long</td>
    <td>location_type</td>
    <td>conflict_date</td>
    <td>population/capacity</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>AA</td>
    <td>ABC</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
    <td>conflict_zone</td>
    <td>yyyy/mm/dd</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>BB</td>
    <td>ABC</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
    <td>conflict_zone</td>
    <td>yyyy/mm/dd</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>CC</td>
    <td>ABC</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
    <td>conflict_zone</td>
    <td>yyyy/mm/dd</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Z</td>
    <td>ZZ</td>
    <td>ZZZ</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
    <td>camp</td>
    <td>-</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
  </tr>
</table>


* The last column in **locations.csv** is capacity for camp location. Camp capacity is the highest number of refugees for each camp and obtained from individual camp csv files. 

**Example: Camp Z** 
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2015-03-31</td>
    <td>11470</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2015-06-02</td>
    <td>12405</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2015-07-24</td>
    <td>12405</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2015-08-31</td>
    <td>11359</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2015-09-30</td>
    <td>8129</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
  </tr>
</table>

CampZ.csv has the highest number of refugees (12405) on 2015-06-02, so we set that as the camp capacity in locations.csv for Camp Z. 

It is also important to highlight that refugee registrations for camps have corrections to overcome inaccurate registrations. To consider this factor in simulation, identify level 1 registration that is decline in refugee numbers. In the case of this example, there is drop from 11359 to 8129 and thus take into account new registration date – 2015-09-30. **Please note that corrections for Level 1 registrations are not done automatically in the CSV-based simulations, but are present in the hard-coded scripts**.

* Identify locations
Identified conflict zones and camps provide origin and destination locations to determine the main routes through which refugees flee. Use [http://www.bing.com/maps](http://www.bing.com/maps) (or other mapping services) to connect conflict zones and camps and add additional locations as town to **locations.csv** as illustrated below:

**locations.csv**
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>name</td>
    <td>region</td>
    <td>country</td>
    <td>lat</td>
    <td>long</td>
    <td>location_type</td>
    <td>conflict_date</td>
    <td>population/capacity</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>AA</td>
    <td>ABC</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
    <td>conflict_zone</td>
    <td>yyyy/mm/dd</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>BB</td>
    <td>ABC</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
    <td>conflict_zone</td>
    <td>yyyy/mm/dd</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>CC</td>
    <td>ABC</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
    <td>conflict_zone</td>
    <td>yyyy/mm/dd</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Z</td>
    <td>ZZ</td>
    <td>ZZZ</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
    <td>camp</td>
    <td>-</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>N</td>
    <td>NN</td>
    <td>ABC</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
    <td>xxx</td>
    <td>town</td>
    <td>-</td>
    <td>-</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### 4. Constructing Network Maps
Construct network map and create **routes.csv** file for simulation, which has the following format:

* **routes.csv**
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>name1</td>
    <td>name2</td>
    <td>distance [km]</td>
    <td>forced_redirection</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>x1</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>x2</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>x3</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>N</td>
    <td>x4</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>N</td>
    <td>x3</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>N</td>
    <td>Z</td>
    <td>x5</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>


* forced_redirection refers to redirection from source location (can be town or camp) to destination location (mainly camp) and source location indicated as forwarding_hub. The value of 0 indicates no redirection, 1 indicates redirection (from name2) to name1and 2 corresponds to redirection (from name1) to name2. 

### 5. Define Border and link closures.

Another required csv file is **closures.csv**, which describes camp or border closure events. These can be specified per country or per location, and have the following format:

**closures.csv**
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>closure_type*</td>
    <td>name1</td>
    <td>name2</td>
    <td>closure_start = 0*</td>
    <td>closure_end = -1*</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>- location</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>- country</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
    <td>…</td>
  </tr>
</table>


* closure_type has 2 possible values: *location* corresponding camp closure and *country* referring to border closure

* *closure_start* and *closure_end* are given as integers, counting the number of days after the simulation start. The value of 0 indicates the start, while -1 indicates the end of the simulation.

### 6. Creating the validation data directory 

Before starting any simulations, you will first have to specify the data you wish to validate against.
You can specify csv file names for each camp/destination locations by creating data_layout.csv in the following format:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>total</td>
    <td>csv file containing total refugee counts</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;Camp Name&gt;</td>
    <td>&lt;CampName.csv&gt;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>...</td>
    <td>...</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### 7. Run simulation with the newly created CSV files.

If you created the CSV files correctly, then you should have three input CSV files in:
```
<your_csv_input_directory>/locations.csv
<your_csv_input_directory>/routes.csv
<your_csv_input_directory>/closures.csv
```

As well as some refugee data to validate agains in:
```
<your_validation_data_directory>/data_layout.csv
<your_validation_data_directory>/<name_of_camp_csv_file>
```

...with one data file for each camp, as indicated by the contents you put in data_layout csv. 

**Note that some kind of validation CSV data for each camp is currently required to run the simulations. However, if you want you can circumvent this by using dummy values in your validation CSV files**

To run a "vanilla" simulation with your newly created CSV files, use:
```
mkdir -p <output_directory>
python3 run_csv_vanilla.py <your_csv_input_directory> <your_validation_data_directory> <duration in days> > <output_directory>/<output_csv_file>
python3 plot-flee-output.py <output_directory>
```
